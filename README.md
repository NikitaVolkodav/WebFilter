# WebFilter

I have created a new application called WebFilter, where I delved into WebKit and its properties. In this project, I implemented the creation of UI elements using code instead of Storyboard. The purpose of this application is to work with the Google search engine and add filters that restrict access to specific websites matching the filter criteria.

With WebFilter, users can easily add filters to their Google search results. Once a filter is applied, Google will prevent access to any websites that match the filter. This feature provides a convenient way to customize and refine search results based on specific preferences or requirements.

By leveraging WebKit's capabilities and utilizing code-based UI creation, WebFilter offers a seamless user experience. Users can navigate through the application effortlessly, accessing a variety of options to enhance their Google search functionality.

WebFilter simplifies the process of managing search results by empowering users to control the content they encounter while using Google. With just a few clicks, users can add filters to exclude unwanted websites, ensuring a more tailored and efficient search experience.

Overall, I am proud to present this new application that showcases my exploration of WebKit and demonstrates my ability to create UI elements programmatically. WebFilter provides an innovative solution for filtering Google search results, giving users more control over their online browsing experience.
